This is an improved version of the "Galaxy Invader" game.
<br>
As we all know, sound effect and music are some crucial part of a game. They make games more engaging and fun.
<br>
In this game I added sound and music to the game, using the "pygame.mixer()" module.
<br>
By using this module I was able to add the following sounds:
<br>
-laser shooting sound
<br>
-intro music
<br>
-damage sound
<br>
-level up sound
<br>
-heart depletion sound
<br>
-game over sound

Also I added different fonts to the game to make it look better and presentable.
<br>
To do so, I used "pygame.font()" madule for font work.
<br>
Using this text I have changed the text:
<br>
-at the menu
<br>
-the level text
<br>
-the hearts text
<br>
-the game over text

**AND**
I also added a simple background to the game using "pygame.image.load()" module.
It is a simple space image as a background, but it give the game a nice look and space vibe.
So now you wont be playing in the void....

These are the resouces I used:
