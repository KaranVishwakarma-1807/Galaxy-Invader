This is a space shooter game, which is made using Pygame module.

This is the initial version of the game, where I learned how perform different functions such as
<br>
-handling collisions (between ships and lasers)
<br>
-projectiles as lasers
<br>
-levels
<br>
-lives
<br>
-health bar
<br>
-shooting of the laser

Also in this project I learned how to create a "Main Menu" for the game.

Again like my other projects, I learned everything from the Pygaem documentations and the online resources and references and made this game.
I hope this will help you in anyway and you will get to learn something as I did....
And if not that, enjoy the game!!!
<br>
Thank You!!
