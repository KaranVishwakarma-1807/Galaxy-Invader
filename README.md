# Galaxy-Invader
This is a single-player, space shooter game, made using Pygame module. In this game player's task is to free the galaxy from the swarm of enemy ships. 
<br>

In this game, player controls a spaceships and shoots a laser to destroy the horde of enemy ships. In this game player's main objective is to only survive as long they can.
<br>

In the game player has to clear the waves/horde/level of enemies.
<br>
And by clearing each wave/horde/level, the number of enemy increases, also I with each hit player's ship get the damage of 10% and with each enemy ship passing the player ship decreases player's life by 1, which makes the game more engaging, thrill and fun.
<br>

This is my favourite project so far.
<br>
In this game, I got to learn so many things about programming and desiging.
<br>
Again, I didn't do all this myself, I took help from online tutorials, documentaions and examples.
<br>
Also I have been trying to improve this as much as I can and make it look more like a game.
<br>
You can see there are different versions of this game, i.e.
<br>
-**Version 0 :** This is the initial version of the game, which I made while learning.
<br>
-**Version 1.0 :** This is the second version in which I added music and sound effects using mixer module.
<br>
-**Version 1.1 :** This is the most current version of the game where I tried to make the game look more polihed, appealing, engaging and fun.
<br>
Also in future, I'll try to add more and more features, to make it more game like rather than just a python project.
<br>

I hope you'll find someting useful from this and please do try the game(the lastest version).
<br>
